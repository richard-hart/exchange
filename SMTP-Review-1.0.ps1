.SYNOPSIS
    Script is intended to help determine servers that are using an Exchange server to connect and send email.
    
    This is especially pertinent in a decomission scenario, where the logs are to be checked to ensure that all SMTP traffic has been moved to the correct endpoint.



.DESCRIPTION

    Logs on an Exchange 2010 servers are here by default.
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V14\TransportRoles\Logs\ProtocolLog\SmtpReceive

    Note that the script can be easily modified for other versions, or to look at the SMTPSend logs instead.  

	
    An empty array is declared that will be used to hold the data gathered during each iteration. 
    This allows for the additional information to be easily added on, and then either echo it to the screen or export to a CSV file

.ASSUMPTIONS
    Logging was enabled to generate the required log files.
    Logging was enabled previously, and time was allowed to colled the data in the logs

    Not all activity will be present on a given server.  Will have to check multiple in most deployments.
    Not all activity will be present in the logs.  For example, Exchange maintains 30 days of logs by default.  This will not catch connections for processes whicj
    send email once a quarter or once a fiscal year.

    Assuption is that something will likely be negatively impacted.  Application ownsers should have been told to update their config, so we can say "unlucky" to them...

	You can live with the Write-Host cmdlets :) 

	You can add your error handling if you need it.
